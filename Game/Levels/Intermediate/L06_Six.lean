Introduction "In this problem you will look at proving that the composition of two continuous maps is
continuous

Some things you should know:
- A subset of a space `X` is an element of the type `set X` in Lean
- The notation for the preimage of a set `U` along a map `f` is `f ⁻¹' U`

You will need to use the tactics intro, rewrite, and apply for this problem!
And some new lemmas that are in the sidebar for you.
