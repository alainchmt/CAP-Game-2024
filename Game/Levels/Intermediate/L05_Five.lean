World "Intermediate"
Level 5

Introduction "In this level you will prove the more complicated
identity (5) in <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Commutator#Identities_(group_theory)>, called
the Hall-Witt identity.  "

Statement {G : Type*} [Group G] {x y z : G} :
 [[x ; y⁻¹]; z] ^ y * [[y; z⁻¹]; x] ^ z * [[z; x⁻¹]; y] ^ x = 1 := by
  simp only [commutator_def, inv_inv, mul_assoc, mul_inv_rev, conjugate_def, inv_mul_cancel_left,
    mul_inv_cancel_left, mul_left_inv]

LemmaDoc mul_assoc as "mul_assoc" in "Group Theory"
  "The group operation is associative."
